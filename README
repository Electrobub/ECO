ECO
Electronic Component Organiser
--------------------------------------
This program is still under works.
--------------------------------------

This program was made to help store and arrange
collections of electrical components. Upon searching and
not finding a program that fit my needs (all I wanted was something
simple and easy to use) I decided to write my own.

Not only was this program made out of the sheer usability for my
everyday tasks but also as a base for learning how to use Qt for GUIs
and for learning how to use GitHub.
